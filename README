A repository for my simple search application the British Museum Map.

This project is an ongoing attempt to provide an easily searchable 
index of the British Museum's rooms. This project uses a Bootstrap 
template to be accesable to both desktop and mobile users. The backend 
runs on a MySQL database with Python functions serving the information 
searched for. 

Future iterations of the project will hopefully include an Museum 
Object Search, images of rooms and objects, more detailed descriptions, 
and improved aesthetics. 

All information pertaining to the museum itself is the Copyright Â© of 
Trustees of the British Museum.

Please enjoy and if you have any questions or comments you can contact 
me through my CV website: www.MoriahSherman.com.
